## Bioacoustics

Bioacoustics is the study of the sounds of animals. In recent years, it has become possible to collect thousands (or even millions) of hours of audio automatically in natural spaces, allowing unprecedented views into wildlife ecology. Extracting knowledge from this data requires a combination of machine learning and statistics, and close collaboration with domain experts in animal communication.

In this course, we will learn about:
- The training, evaluation, and application of a **bioacoustics foundation model** to novel problems
- The geometry of **high-dimensional embedding spaces**
- Unique **statistical challenges** in bioacoustics

The course will focus on a combination of:
- Reading and discussing core research papers
- Implementing key ideas during **computer lab sessions**
